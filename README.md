# CSV Upload Project

This project is a web application that allows users to upload CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files, process the data within them, and store it in a MongoDB database. It is built using the following technologies:

- **EJS**: EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is used for rendering dynamic HTML templates on the server side.

- **Express.js**: Express.js is a Node.js web application framework that is used to handle routing, middleware, and server setup.

- **Node.js**: Node.js is the runtime environment used for server-side scripting in JavaScript.

- **MongoDB**: MongoDB is a NoSQL database used to store the processed data from uploaded CSV files.

- **JavaScript**: JavaScript is used for server-side scripting and client-side interactions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Install the project dependencies.

```bash
cd csv-upload-project
npm install
```

3. Configure MongoDB: Ensure you have MongoDB installed and running locally or provide connection details in the project's configuration.

4. Start the application.

```bash
npm start
```

## Usage

- Access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

- You can upload CSV files containing data that you want to process and store in the MongoDB database.

- The application will parse the CSV data and provide options for further processing and viewing.

## Project Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

- `views/`: Contains EJS templates for rendering the web interface.

- `public/`: Houses static assets such as CSS, JavaScript, and images.

- `routes/`: Defines the routes and logic for handling CSV uploads and data processing.

- `models/`: Contains MongoDB models for defining data schemas.

- `config/`: Stores configuration files for the project.

- `index.js`: The entry point of the application where the server is initialized and routes are defined.
